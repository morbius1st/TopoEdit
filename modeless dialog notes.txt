* place the main window object into AppRibbon.  this object hangs around.  I think that command is transenient and is gone once it hits the return;
* however, in command, load "R" and start the window 
* in appribbon: 

For Modeless to work:

* The activated task will need to know to which window the task is associated.
	* in general, there is a one-to-one relationship that is, the tasks are 
		associated with a window.  however, sub-tasks will be common and cannot
		know the specific window that started the task
	* this means that a part of the task request / task handle system needs
		to have the associated window get registered as the current window
		and the prior current window needs to be pushed into a stack to allow
		it to be poped out later.
	* to assist with this, each subject window will get its own task 
		request / task handler

** configuration

* app ribbon:
> causes the handlers, per window, to be configured
