add points that follows a path

options

* select an existing line or arc
* provide start and end point - linear add
* provide start, mid, and end points - arc add
* provide start and end point + radius & center point side - arc add
* select multiple lines and / or arcs - path add
* select multiple lines and / or arcs & additional points
* provide multiple points - path add via points
 
determine the surface elevation of each point

have chart of control points - use the surface elevation of each point
as the starting point

user can modify the elevation of each control point
user can modify the slope between the control points

elevation adjustments:
* surface elevation +/- distance (relative)
* absolute elevation
* calculated

slope options:
* x:y
* %
* angle

create chart of control points with this info
> segment type - line or arc
> segment start point
* x / y coordinate (can adjust)
* z coordinate (original / surface elevation)
* z adjustment type (relative / absolute / calculated)
* z final (can adjust)
> segment end point
* x / y coordinate (can adjust)
* z coordinate (original / surface elevation)
* z adjustment type (relative / absolute / calculated)
* z final (can adjust)
> arcs
* radius (can adjust)
* center point x / y (cannot adjust)
> slope
* x:y  - or -
* %  - or -
* angle
